[VirtualHere](https://www.virtualhere.com/) is a piece of software that allows you to share USB-devices (Scanner, Printer, Mouse, Keyboard etc.) over the network.

VirtualHere itself is not included in the docker-image directly but rather gets downloaded from the authors website upon the first start of the container. It should also auto-update on every restart.

For VirtualHere to work correctly you have to ensure that you run the container with access to your hosts USB-devices. This can for example be achieved by running in privileged mode (--privileged). 

While the default port 7575 is exposed per default with this image, the usual Auto-Discovery based on Bonjour will not work unless you run the container on the host network. You can however enter the IP and port in the [Client](https://www.virtualhere.com/usb_client_software) manually if you choose not to do so.

Map the /data folder of this container to a folder on your host to get access to the config.ini file that allows you to enter your license information, change different parameters, choose which usb-devices to share etc.

To run on host network use: 
~~~~
$ docker run -d -v /host/directory:/data --network=host --privileged --name moritzf-virtualhere moritzf/virtualhere:latest
~~~~
Otherwise use:
~~~~
$ docker run -d -v /host/directory:/data -p 7575:7575 --privileged --name moritzf-virtualhere moritzf/virtualhere:latest
~~~~
(Replace "/host/directory" with a valid directory on your host machine)

The trial-license allows you to share one usb-device. For multiple devices and more advanced features (such as traffic-encryption, user-authentication etc.), you will have to purchase a license from the author of VirtualHere. Always support a developers hard work if you think it is worth it!
